This library is designed to provide utilities for cleaning CSV datasets that contain technical language. Mudlark has three main purposes:

- Rapid and easy preprocessing of CSV datasets that have a text column
- Exporting a CSV dataset to a JSON file that can be readily imported into `QuickGraph <https://quickgraph.tech>`_, so that you can annotate the textual portion of your CSV dataset
- Normalising a single piece of text which involves replacing any words appearing in a predefined "corrections dictionary" with suitable replacements. You can view this dictionary `here <https://github.com/nlp-tlp/mudlark/blob/main/mudlark/dictionaries/mwo_corrections.csv>`_.

Note that at this stage, the pipeline-based normalisation method that we use is designed for maintenance work orders, but it is also applicable to other domains featuring similar technical language.
